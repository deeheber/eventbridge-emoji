# eventbridge-emoji

Wanted to test to see if I could create an EventBridge rule with only emojis. Turns out it works.

`npm install && npm run cdk deploy` to deploy the stack (once your AWS credentials are in place)

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
